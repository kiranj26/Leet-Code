Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository! Here, I am tackling various LeetCode questions to enhance my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking. ðŸ˜„

ðŸ”¥ LeetCode Quote of the Day: "Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning." - Rick Cook

## Why LeetCode?

LeetCode is a popular platform for sharpening programming skills and preparing for coding interviews. It offers a wide range of algorithmic problems with different difficulty levels. By solving these problems, I aim to enhance my problem-solving abilities, optimize algorithms, and become familiar with common coding patterns.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on different topics and problem categories. Each folder contains the solutions to various LeetCode questions, along with explanations and comments.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the repository and browse through the solutions. You can navigate to specific topics or problems that interest you. I have provided detailed explanations and comments in the code to help understand the thought process behind each solution.
